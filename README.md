# gulp-build-system
This is the gulp build system setup used for the majority of projects.

##Installation

To get started with the system you must ensure that you have gulp and jshint installed globally. If not you can install them by calling the following in your terminal:

```
npm install -g gulp jshint
```

The next step is to clone this repo into your desired project folder. (Note the period after the URL will place the files directly into the cwd without a folder wrapper).

```
git clone https://github.com/MurrayCreative/gulp-build-system.git . 
```

Pulling down the repo will also pull down a readme, license and also the .git file itself. To remove these files just run the following:

```
rm -rf .git README.md LICENSE
```

Once the files have been successfully pulled down, run the follwing to install dependenices:

```
npm install
```

##File Structure

This gulp setup is based on the below folder structure. 

```
├── assets
│	├── dist
	│   ├── css
	│   ├── fonts
	│   ├── images
	│   └── js
│	└── src
	    ├── bower_components
	    ├── css
	    ├── images
	    ├── js
	    ├── scss
	    └── svg-sprites
```

##Cusomization

The gulpfile contains a series of variables which can be modified to change various aspects of your build. The most important thing to remember to change is the *baseUrl*

```
var baseUrl = '<%= site_url %>'; // Local Development URL for BrowserSync. Change as-needed. e.g http://website:8888
// var baseDir = './app'; // Browsersync server base directory when not using proxy url above
var showScssLint = false; // turn scsslint on or off
var showJsHint = false; // turn JShint on or off
var spritesPrefix = "icon-";

/*  Style paths
    ========================================================================== */

var styleSRC = 'assets/src/scss/**/*.scss'; // Path to main .scss file
var styleDist = 'assets/dist/css/'; // Path to place the compiled CSS file
var styleWatchFiles = 'assets/src/scss/**/*.scss'; // Path to all *.scss files inside css folders

/*  JS paths
    ========================================================================== */

var jsSRC = 'assets/src/js/main.js'; // Path to main js file
var jsDist = 'assets/dist/js/'; // Path to place the compiled js file
var jsWatchFiles = 'assets/src/js/**/*.js'; // Path to all js files inside src folder

/*  Images and SVG paths
    ========================================================================== */

var imgSRC = 'assets/src/images/**';
var imgDist = 'assets/dist/images/';
var svgSRC = 'assets/src/svg-sprites/**';

```

##Run 

Once you have made any sort of modifications to the variables. Please ensure you change the name & description in the package.json file.
Just run the following and you will be good to go!

```
gulp
```
